Bryan: 
- Test out current working version in root. 
- Add comments to Deque and Queue classes
- Research on Timer class and Processing implementation of game

Brooke, Jen (Individual tasks allocated tomorrow in class):
- Begin writing SDish, MDish, LDish classes
- Instance variables: dishName, dishTime (necessitates Timer class knowledge), ArrayList of Strings with dishNames
- On Instantiation, each dish should have a randomized name and a constant dishTime (depending on whether it is a SDish, MDish or LDIsh)
- Should these extend the Order class? Does the relationship SDish is-a Order make sense? 
- Incorporate Timer class functions in the Kitchen class. 
    - dishes with lower dishTime should be placed at the front of the pending food deque. 
    - Kitchen should only produce food after an elapsed time has passed. 
    - MAYBE the kitchen should send a notification everytime food is produced. 
    - In the Driver, the Restaurant has-a Kitchen, which the waiter should be able to access to pick up food items and drop off food requests. 


- Instead of spawning customers, some of them can be randomly added throughout the course of the level, but only to a certain limit.
