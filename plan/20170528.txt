Vision for PekingWong: 
- A waiter, represented by a circle in Vanilla version 
- The waiter is not moved by arrow keys, but rather follows a path from table to table. 
- Diner Dash Endless is going to be implemented instead of a bunch of levels, with a set number of tables (8), but start off with two tables as functional
  - The layout in the Vanilla version will show 8 tables. However, the mechanics only allow the Waiter to work with two tables in the outset. 8 tables are shown for Brooke's part (shown below), where she creates the path to all 8 tables. 
- Customers can be dragged to their tables
- Clicking on tables does the action required by the table: 
  - If the customers are ready to order, you take their order
  - If you have the customer's food, you serve it to them 
  - If the customer is ready to leave, give them their check. 
- The mood of the customer determines how much money you receive at the end

Changes: 
- Each Table only places one order. (Therefore, we don't need the SDish, MDish, LDish classes)
- Make Restaurant a sort of driver file, in that it incorporates the graphics part with the mechanics of the game. In PekingWong, you should be able to create a new Restaurant and then do something like Restaurant.run()

Assignments: 
Bryan: Continue working on graphics, follow the example of the Diner Dash video sent in the group chat
Jen: Write Display functions for the necessary classes, and make the click-and-drag customer capability as well as the ability of tables to be clicked. 
Brooke: Wait for Jen before editing, but modify v.1.8, and create a series of paths for the Waiter to navigate table to table non-awkwardly.
