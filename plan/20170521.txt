State: 
Current working version in root: v.1.1
Versions to add features to (navigate to corresponding folder in Versions/): 
Brooke: v.1.2 (Just add Kitchen class file)
Jen: v.1.3, v.1.4

Jen: 
- Create commands for the waiter
(I have these written on paper somewhere) 
- Write SDish, MDish and LDish classes

Bryan: 
- Finish up research of Timer class. If you have time, maybe look into how the game could be coded in Processing. 
- Research should include not code, but just like, functions in the Timer class that could be useful, what they do, how they can be helpful for a certain task in the Peking Wong Restaurant (e.g. this function can be used to determine how much time a customer has been waiting, etc)
- For processing, look into images, and how we could load images to create animations

Brooke: 
- Start on the Kitchen class. 
  - Deque used for the Pending Food List
  - Queue for the Finished Food List
  - ^^ Make these handle strings, later today I'll try to write the SmallDish, MedDish, LDish classes, and I'll put those in as the object types for the Deque and Queue
  - A Kitchen should makeFood(), for now, this function can probably just removeFirst from the deque and then enqueue that item in the finished food list
  - Most important is probably the toString() method, which should print out like a table thing, pending food in one column, finished food in the other column (w headers that specify which column is what) 
  - Don't worry about incorporating Kitchen into any other class, just write a main method within the Kitchen class and try to test if the deque and queue work 
     - I'm thinking later that Kitchen could be an instance variable type for the Restaurant class, like the Restaurant has-a Kitchen
- Ik this is a lot, so if you're super busy today, just lmk and I'll try to do part of this^^
