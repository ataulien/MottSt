Jen: 
- Begin to utilize the Time class in order to: 
   - update customers' moods if they haven't been served after a while
   - Have the kitchen take a certain amount of time to cook food
- Create customer spawning mechanism

Brooke and Bryan: 
EDIT THE VERSION IN THE FOLDER "V.2.2"
- Begin to code to plug in graphics
- Load images and utilize animation for the following tasks: 
   - waiter should change direction visually
   - When a waiter picks up a dish, it should be visually shown 
   - Kitchen is the lucky cat, it moves its paw when clicked on
   - Load images into classes (tables should look like tables, customers should look like customers, etc)
	- if you want to vary how the customers look, you can create an arraylist of PImages and just extract random ones from there for each customer spawned
- @BRYAN: if you have time, try to create the start screen, end screen, and instructions page for the game. Either way, it has to be done before the weekend ends

WE r trying to spend all Monday debugging, not adding new features! Let's start da grind
