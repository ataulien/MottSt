Brooke: 
- Modify Restaurant class with Priority heap structure
  - removeCustomer should remove the highest priority Customer
  - waitList should be priority heap
  - serveList should remain as ArrayList, current functionality already makes sure that earlier customers are served first
  - maybe, if you want, you can add a reservations priority heap, but don't write methods for it yet. 
- When you finish, make sure it compiles and works! Your version should be v.1.2, but don't make a folder for it yet. We need a runnable version from the root of the repo, I'll move it when I expand the classes (-Jen)

Bryan: 
- Do some research on the Timer class in Java, probably will be implementing in like v.1.4/5  
  - link is: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Timer.html
  - find useful methods for following functionalities
    - time stamp for when a customer is first seated
    - time stamp for when a customer first arrives at the restaurant
    - something to keep track of elapsed time e.g. if a customer waits too long, she/he leaves the restaurant
    - maybe some sort of delay e.g. main courses will take a longer time to be prepared than a beverage
- Make a .txt file w your findings :) put in da root

Jen: 
- Fleshing out the ideal flow for the final game (vision still nebulous)
- Create the waiter commands and the Kitchen class
- Maybe we need a Kitchen class? We'll see.
